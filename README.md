Uvic Co-op Work Term Template
=============
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/trstephen/work-term-report.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/trstephen/work-term-report)

A set of LaTeX files that generates a work term report following the Uvic co-op department's [style guide](https://www.uvic.ca/coopandcareer/assets/docs/studentsalumni/engineering_work_term_report_guide.pdf). A [full installation of LaTeX](http://latex-project.org/ftp.html) is assumed regarding the packages included in the document.

The end goal of this project is to create an encaspulated style file and guidebook that will be used by other students for their work term reports. This distribution is intended to elicit feedback regarding usability and, hopefully, bring any bugs to light.

The included files should compile and produce pdfs that match their *_demo* counterparts.

Send feedback via Github through @trstephen or via [email](mailto:tstephen@uvic.ca).
