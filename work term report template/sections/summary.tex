\begin{Summary}
The summary is written for the general reader who wishes to be familiar with the content of the report while avoiding details. The summary is a separate report, stating the engineering problem, the approach to the solution, the main conclusions and recommendations. It is written after the main report has been completed. Items in the main report such as tables, figures or sections, are not referred to in the summary. The summary is normally presented centered on its own page, and is less than one page in length.
